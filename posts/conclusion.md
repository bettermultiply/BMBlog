&emsp;It seems that it's a little hard to conclude my college life for the year because there was nothing special happened in this year.

&emsp;To be honest, the only imagination I have had about my university's life is that I can learn knew, interesting knowledges freely rather than review the immutable and boring knowledges of the High school, it's an **UNFORGIVABLE WASTE** of time. Happily, just like my assumption, as the life started, most of new knowledges I was eager for floated me and I was burried in happy business.

&emsp;However, the knowledge didn't satisfied me in the same time. ***There were too many useless knowledges!!!***, or in other words, some of the lessons made unpleasant like *Electrical_Circuit*, *Introduction to Modern China History*, etc. They were sucked.

&emsp;OK, come back to myself. Instead of the school lesson, Who dispointted me most is myself. Yes, it's me. Alought it is pretty crazy, I have no doubt that I can pointed out one hundred, two hundred or even more disadvantange of myself, too lazy, recoiling in most times, too fat and so on. I looked forward to changing myself for years without any action. I wish I can be better in the later year, just like every year I've suffered in the past years.

&emsp;I don't think it's a likeable method to blame myself endlessly. So it may be a awesome idea to **talk about the future.**

&emsp;In the following year, I have so many goals to be realized that I have to abandon some of them to ensure I have enough energy to make them become a truth strategically.

1. **Making my blog better**: I constructed my own blog this summer holiday using tools like nextjs, vercel, github and so on. I wish I can make it to be a better one with more beautiful designs, more interesting  functions, more high quality article like my weekly reports(Maybe weekly reports can be a lifelong work, it's just a wish HAHA.)

2. **Take up once dropped job**: Serendipity, I joined a college students' science and technology innovation team. But I pay few time on it. "You can do nothing for it, you are dooming to fail," I told myself like that so that I stop my pace to go head. I really hope I can reboot it, devote really contributions to it and not let my teammates be dispointed.

3. **Be healthy**: Yeah, just I said, I am so fat that I have some illnesses(although not all caused by my fat). 
*Run More, Eat Healthier, Live More Regularly And Stay in Room Less.*

&emsp;Ok maybe those are all.

&emsp;I have to say that three years are **too long too long** for me. I can't imgine how I'll be that time so I can tell my goals too others. All those three-years goals of me are inauthentic in my eyes. I just wish I can proudly say at that time:

### "I SET GOALS IN THE BOTTOM OF MY MIND THREE YEARS AGO, 

### SO I EMBARKED ON THE JOURNEY, AND JUST REACH THE DESTINATION."

&emsp;In the last, I want to write down a sentence I love a lot &rarr; *所有真理都是弯曲的，时间本身就是一个圆*
