&emsp;â€‹It is really an obvious truth that I have just pursued too many things without destinations. What I want when I did those? I don't know. Maybe just show others,"Look! I am so hardworking, I have so many useful and cool skill!" But wait, what I gained from such behaviors? Nothing. I pursued something for a while and turn myself to others when laymen will think "Wow! you are powerful and skillful!" or when I got bored with a skill(retreating from difficulties is also an important reason why I gave up).
